        How we really use Web
    </h1>
    <p>
        In this principle, It said, " We don't read pages. We scan them", People will not spend much time on reading the words in the website,
        All they do is scanning the website and find the keywords they interested. In the age of the information explosion, no one will read the paragraph which can not catch
        their attention at once. In the most time, people use the website to save time, if designer add more words, it will spend more time for the people to read them.
        This is also contrary to the idea of the internet. "Easy", "Simple" and "Fast". So designer should have a highlight keywords to catch people's attention in the website.
        Also, people does not care about how website work, if the website can help them, then they will keep using it. The use's thinking is different from designer. So more easy and more useful
        website will have a high level competitiveness.
