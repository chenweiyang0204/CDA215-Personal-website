            An obvisous title to show the theme of website, A easy use searching bar and less words and so on. To avoid user
            thinks when they are using the website, using simple and straightforward word. No body will care professional or
            deeper words. We can not control what kind of people to use websiteï¼ŒSo the audience for website is people of
            different ages, comes from different fields and with different cultures. So the website design should be
            popularization and common. In this website, I will summarize four principles which comes from book. Which are Don't make me think in the first page, How we really use the web in the second page,
            Omit words in the third page, and Street signs and Breadcrumbs in the fourth page. You can use navigation bar from one to four to access each page.
