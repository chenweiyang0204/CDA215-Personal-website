        In this principle, it talks about searching bar. In usual, people will try to look at the searching bar first when they entry a website.
        For example, people using Amazon and Ebay, they need to use searching bar to find what they want directly. Navigation is also the important
        part for this principle, they navigation is not only to be a tourist guide but also be a GPS, A good navigation can let people realize where they are
        right now. Most of people like to use back button to return to the Home page of the website. For them, it seems to restart the website. The reason they do
        this action is missing the direction in the web. So if have a good navigation, it can help people to know their direction for now, and reduce user's time on
        restarting the web.
