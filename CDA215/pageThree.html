    <h1>
        Omit words
    </h1>
    <p>
        This principle is about omiting needless words, deleting all unnecessary words, it would make your website more messy.
        In the book it mention that "happy talk must die, instructions must die." I agree with that. The happy talk would not help
        website more functional, unnecessary greetings will not give users a good impression. And most time users would not waste their
        time to read instructions, they prefer using the website independently by clicking website button or something else. The long paragraph of instructions will
        make website looks boring. So kill the unnecessary words in the website is the key to keep website clean and fancy.
